# Adjacency Matrix Backed Graphs

This repository is a short reference implementation for creating adjacency Matrix
backed graphs of a pre-defined capacity and constructing hierarchical lattices
using them. A package with more capabilities will be released once ready.

You can use this example by cloning the repository and including `main.jl` in your
session. For instance, to create a generation 4 lattice with branching number $b=2$
you can do something like the following.
